\ Project Overview



The \AI Detective Escape Game\ is an interactive browser-based game where the player investigates a murder inside a mansion. The player interrogates suspects, collects clues, and uses AI-powered hints to deduce the killer before making the final accusation. The game simulates an AI detective assistant that evaluates clues and gives subtle suggestions, enhancing the immersive experience.







\ Game Features



\ Three main suspects: \Meera, Kabir, Raghav\.  

\ AI-generated hints based on clues and suspect behavior.  

\ Sequential interrogation and clue collection system.  

\ Decision-based gameplay: choices affect AI scoring but lead to a single final outcome.
